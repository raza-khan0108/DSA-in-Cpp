# DSA in C++

Welcome to my **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** repository implemented in **C++**. This repository contains a wide range of solved problems and concept implementations that serve as a reference for learners and interview preparation.

## 🚀 What You'll Learn

This repository is packed with learning material across fundamental DSA topics and C++ programming concepts:

### 🧮 Arrays & Searching
- Basic array manipulation and passing arrays to functions
- Set operations using arrays
- Merge and search (Binary Search)
- 2D Arrays and matrix operations

### 🔁 Recursion and Backtracking
- Tower of Hanoi problem using recursion

### 🧠 Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- Classes and objects in C++
- Member functions inside and outside class
- Inheritance including diamond problem demonstration

### 🧵 Functions and Parameters
- Function definitions and calls
- Call by value, call by reference, and call by address
- Function overloading and parameter passing variations

### 🧱 Data Structures
- Stack and heap memory usage
- Diagonal matrix representation
- Heap implementation

### 📌 Additional Concepts
- Getters, setters, and utility operations (max, min)
- Use of functions for common utilities
- Array-specific functions and modularization
